# TazÄ± Project

Objective is to simulate 2 concurrent tasks:

+ Continuosly Growing Datasource, simulating a client's input to our database
+ Confusion Matrix calculations based on sliding window over 1000 predictions from 3 different models

Note: Please check (non-docker branch)[https://github.com/TuanSSM/tazi-project/tree/non-docker] as it is better performing for now.

## Backend

Both tasks run on different threads. Confusion Matrix calculations starts immediately as datastorege gets populated. Confusion Matrix calculation are done whenever it is possible

Also there is an API support both for new inputs and User Interface. Docs are located at `localhost:8000/docs`
Calculation thread waits for new inputs on Database even after the fixed input (CSV data) has finished 

## UI

On `localhost:8501` there is an interface for visualisation of the given matrix id, and information for the upcoming matrix.

# How to use it

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

Open your browser and check
+ [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) for backend
+ [localhost:8501](localhost:8501) for frontend

# Todo

+ Docker memory & cpu optimization (especially for postgres)
+ Unit testing
+ Logging
